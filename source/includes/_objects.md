Before diving into BlockCypher's endpoints, this section details all the Objects exposed and expected by the API. Some of you might be more interested in the endpoints themselves, in which case, feel free to [skip to the next section.](#blockchain-api) For each Object there's a description and a link to a germane API endpoint.


<aside class="notice">
Objects sometimes contain <b>attributes</b> that are <b><i>optional.</i></b> These are always noted in the <b>description</b>. In these cases, the Object may not be guaranteed to include that <b>attribute</b> in its response.

A Contract represents an embedded contract on the Ethereum blockchain, and is used with both creating and executing contracts in our [Contract API](#contract-api). All the fields below are generally ***optional***, but may be required depending on the particular contract endpoint you're using.

Attribute | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
**solidity** | *string* | Solidity code of this contract; required when creating a contract. In responses, only returned with contracts initially compiled by BlockCypher.
**params** | Array[*string*] | Parameters for either contract creation or method execution.
**publish** | Array[*string*] | Named contract(s) to publish; necessary to specify when first [creating a contract](#create-contract-endpoint).
**private** | *string* | Private key associated with a funded Ethereum external account used to publish a contract or execute a method.
**gas_limit** | *int* | Maximum amount of gas to use in contract creation or method execution.
**value** | *int* | Amount (in wei) to transfer; can be used when [creating a contract](#creat-contract-endpoint) or [calling a method.](#call-contract-method-endpoint)
**name** | *string* | Name of contract as published.
**bin** | *string* | Hex-encoded binary compilation of this contract.
**abi** | *[ABI](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Contract-ABI)* |  JSON-encoded ABI. Only returned with contracts initially compiled by BlockCypher.
**address** | *string* | Hex-encoded address of this contract.
**created** | *[time](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339)* | Timestamp when this contract was confirmed in the Ethereum blockchain.
**creation_tx_hash** | *string* | Hex-encoded transaction hash that created this contract.
**results** | Array[*string*] | If this is a response from a [calling a contract method](#call-contract-method-endpoint), this array of results may appear if the method returns any.

## Event

```shell
curl -s https://api.blockcypher.com/v1/eth/main/hooks/ce83d08f-7b86-4a6a-9b41-85507648f9c7?token=YOURTOKEN

  "callback_errors": 0,

  "filter": "addr=c5beef03aaa9548210b5550a62f7756efaa08ba3\u0026event=unconfirmed-tx"
}
```

An Event represents a WebHooks or WebSockets-based notification request, as detailed in the [Events & Hooks](#events-and-hooks) section of the documentation.

Attribute | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
**id** | *string* | Identifier of the event; generated when a new request is created.
**event** | *string* | Type of event; can be *unconfirmed-tx*, *new-block*, *confirmed-tx*, *tx-confirmation*, *double-spend-tx*.
**hash**	| *string* | ***optional*** Only objects with a matching hash will be sent. The hash can either be for a block or a transaction.
**address**	| *string* | ***optional*** Only transactions associated with the given address will be sent. 
**confirmations** | *integer* | ***optional***  Used in concert with the *tx-confirmation* event type to set the number of confirmations desired for which to receive an update. You'll receive an updated [TX](#tx) for every confirmation up to this amount. The maximum allowed is 10; if not set, it will default to 6.
**url** | *url* | ***optional*** Callback URL for this Event's WebHook; not applicable for WebSockets usage.
**callback_errors** | *int* | Number of errors when attempting to POST to callback URL; not applicable for WebSockets usage.
